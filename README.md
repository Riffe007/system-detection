# üîß Rust System Monitor

A **real-time, cross-platform system monitoring application** built with **Tauri v2** (Rust backend + React frontend).  
Collects comprehensive CPU, memory, GPU, disk, network, and process metrics using a clean architecture and extensible backend. Designed as a lightweight, open-source foundation for system diagnostics, embedded monitoring tools, or performance dashboards.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### ‚úÖ Requirements

- **Rust** (latest stable version)
- **Node.js** (v18 or later)
- **pnpm** (recommended) or npm
- **NVIDIA drivers** (for GPU monitoring - optional)

### üî® Build & Run

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Riffe/system-detection.git
cd system-detection
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Build and run in development mode:

```bash
pnpm run tauri dev
```

Build for production:

```bash
pnpm run tauri build
```

### üéØ Running the Application

**Important**: This application requires the Tauri runtime and cannot run in a regular browser. The application will show an error if launched in a browser environment.

When running correctly, you'll see:
- A **native application window** (not a browser tab)
- **Real system data** (no mock data)
- **Live updating metrics** every second
- **Interactive dashboard** with draggable widgets

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Backend (Rust/Tauri)
- **`src-tauri/src/monitoring.rs`**: Core monitoring service using `sysinfo` crate
- **Async metrics collection**: Tokio-based background monitoring
- **Event-driven updates**: Real-time metrics pushed to frontend
- **GPU monitoring**: NVIDIA NVML integration for GPU metrics
- **Rate calculation**: Real-time I/O and network rate tracking

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)
- **Modern React 18** with hooks and functional components
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling with dark/light theme support
- **Recharts** for data visualization
- **Drag-and-drop dashboard** using `@dnd-kit`
- **Responsive grid layout** with customizable widgets

### Key Components
- **`AppWrapper.tsx`**: Main application logic and Tauri integration
- **`DraggableDashboard.tsx`**: Interactive dashboard with widget management
- **Monitor Components**: Individual monitoring widgets (CPU, Memory, GPU, etc.)
- **`useMetricsHistory.ts`**: Custom hook for historical data tracking

---

## üîß Configuration

### GPU Monitoring
GPU monitoring requires:
1. **NVIDIA GPU** with supported drivers
2. **NVML library** (included via `nvml-wrapper` crate)
3. **Feature flag enabled** (enabled by default)

To disable GPU monitoring:
```toml
# In Cargo.toml
[features]
default = []  # Remove "nvidia"
```

### Dashboard Customization
- **Drag and drop** widgets to reorder
- **Resize widgets** (small, medium, large, full-width)
- **Show/hide widgets** in edit mode
- **Layout persistence** (saved to localStorage)

## üß™ Testing

Run all tests:

```bash
pnpm run test:all
```

Run specific test suites:

```bash
# Frontend tests
pnpm run test

# Rust backend tests
pnpm run test:rust

# Test coverage
pnpm run test:coverage
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Tauri environment not detected"**
   - Ensure you're running through Tauri, not in a browser
   - Use `pnpm run tauri dev` to launch

2. **GPU monitoring not working**
   - Verify NVIDIA drivers are installed
   - Check that `nvml-wrapper` feature is enabled
   - Ensure you have an NVIDIA GPU

3. **High CPU usage**
   - The app updates every second by default
   - Consider reducing update frequency for older systems

4. **Permission errors**
   - The app needs system access for monitoring
   - Grant necessary permissions when prompted

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting the `RUST_LOG` environment variable:

```bash
RUST_LOG=debug pnpm run tauri dev
```
