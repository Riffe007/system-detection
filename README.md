# üîß Rust System Monitor

An async, modular system metrics collector built in Rust.  
Collects CPU, memory, GPU, and storage information using a clean architecture and extensible backend. Designed as a lightweight, open-source foundation for system diagnostics, embedded monitoring tools, or performance dashboards.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Written in Rust** for speed, safety, and low-level control.
- **Asynchronous** metric collection via [`tokio`](https://tokio.rs/).
- **Modular architecture** with a central `SystemMonitor` interface.
- **Clean CLI output** for real-time system diagnostics.
- **Ready for extension** into daemons, web APIs, or logging services.
- **Open Source** under the MIT License.

## üì¶ Modules

This project is structured into reusable system-specific components:

| Module            | Responsibility                    |
|-------------------|------------------------------------|
| `cpu_monitor.rs`   | Detects CPU usage and core status |
| `memory_monitor.rs`| Retrieves memory usage metrics    |
| `gpu_monitor.rs`   | Queries GPU statistics            |
| `storage_monitor.rs`| Collects disk usage information |
| `logger.rs`        | Optional hook for logging output  |
| `system_monitor.rs`| Aggregates all subsystems into a unified metric snapshot |

## üöÄ Getting Started

### ‚úÖ Requirements

- Rust (latest stable version)
- Cargo

### üî® Build & Run

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Riffe/system-detection.git
cd rust-system-monitor
```
## Build the project
```bash
cargo build --release
```
## Run the monitor
```bash
cargo run --release
```
### This will print a snapshot of the current system metrics to the console:
```bash
CPU Usage: 12.5%
Memory Used: 4.9 GB
GPU Temp: 61.2 ¬∞C
Storage Used: 250 GB / 1 TB
```
Output will vary depending on your operating system and available hardware.

# üîß Architecture Overview
The main runtime is powered by %tokio:%
```rust
fn main() {
    let rt = Runtime::new().unwrap();
    let metrics = rt.block_on(SystemMonitor::collect_metrics());

    for (key, value) in metrics.iter() {
        println!("{}: {}", key, value);
    }
}
```
The SystemMonitor delegates to subsystem modules and returns a HashMap<String, String> containing unified metric data.
# üß† Why This Project?
  - This is part of my systems engineering portfolio and reflects my work in:
  - Designing low-level, high-performance monitoring systems
  - Modular and scalable Rust architectures
  - Cross-platform observability tooling
  - Real-time data systems and performance-aware applications
While this project is open-source, I also develop more advanced proprietary monitoring systems with predictive diagnostics and quantum-inspired state modeling. This lightweight tool is a distilled showcase of clean design and practical insight.
